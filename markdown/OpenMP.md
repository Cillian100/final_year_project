- One of the primary benefits of OpenMP is its ease of use. OpenMP uses a simple pragma based syntax that allows developers to specify parallel regions, loop parallelization, and task based parallelism with minimal modifications to existing code. 
- One issue is that the ease of use provided by OpenMP comes at the cost of some degree of control over the parallelism. Unlike Pthreads, OpenMP provides limited control over scheduling and synchronisation, which can limit the fine tuning of parallel code.
