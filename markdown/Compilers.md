- GCC currently does not allow users to compile projects targeting both OpenMP and OpenACC.
- The issue with the NVC compiler is that it fails to compile more complex code that employs nested parallelism supported in OpenMP.

#### NVC 
- Supports GPU programming with OpenACC and supports multicore CPU programming with OpenACC and OpenMP
#### NVCC
- The CUDA C and CUDA C++ compiler driver for NVIDIA GPUs
